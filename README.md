# Trending Baby Names Data Analysis 📊👶

## Project Overview 📜

This repository contains the code and resources for the Trending Baby Names Data Analysis project. In this project, we explore a comprehensive dataset of baby names in the United States spanning from 1880 to 2022. The goal is to uncover naming trends, variations, and cultural insights over more than a century.

## Streamlit App 🌐

We've developed an interactive Streamlit web application that complements the data analysis. This app allows users to interactively explore the dataset, discover the top 10 baby names based on gender and year selections, and visualize naming trends over time. The Streamlit app enhances the accessibility of the analysis results and provides an engaging way for users to explore the rich history of baby names in the United States.

## Data Dictionary 📚

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Name**: The name of the person.
- **Sex**: The gender associated with the name (Male or Female).
- **Number**: The number of times that name was used in Social Security card applications.
- **Year**: The year associated with each data record.

## Data Preparation 🧹

The data preparation process involved:

- Data retrieval and cleaning: Data was extracted from yearly data files and combined into a single dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We unveiled popular names over time, performed gender-based analysis, and explored variations in name spelling.

## Visualization 📊

We used various visualization techniques to bring the data to life:

- Trend Visualizations: Popularity of names over time using line plots, normalized by the total number of births each year.
- Stacked Area Plot: Visualizing the popularity of variations of the name "Claire" over time.
- Top Names: Identification of the top ten names for each gender and year, presented in tables.
- Unisex Names: Exploration of unisex names by calculating gender ratios and visualizing common unisex names.

## Conclusion 🌟

This analysis of baby names data has revealed captivating trends and patterns in naming preferences over more than a century. These trends provide valuable insights into cultural and societal changes, influencing the choices parents make when naming their children. While specific names used for illustration purposes have seen variations, the broader trends in baby naming reflect the dynamic nature of society's values and influences. This analysis serves as a testament to the richness of historical data and its ability to reveal the evolving tapestry of our culture through something as simple yet meaningful as a name.

## Future Work 🚀

In the future, there is significant potential to expand the capabilities of the Streamlit app, making it an even more versatile tool for exploring baby naming trends. Enhancements may include advanced user interaction features and deeper sociocultural investigations. Additionally, as the dataset continues to receive updates, the app's role in tracking contemporary naming trends will remain crucial, providing ongoing insights into the evolving landscape of baby names in the United States.
